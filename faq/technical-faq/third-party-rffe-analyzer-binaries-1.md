## Third-Party RFFE Analyzer Binaries

Saleae provides a compiled download of the open source RFFE analyzer found here: [https://github.com/alejmrm/RFFEAnalyzer](https://github.com/alejmrm/RFFEAnalyzer)

You can download the Windows DLLs for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the software here: [http://downloads.saleae.com/temp/1.2.5+RFFE.zip](http://downloads.saleae.com/temp/1.2.5+RFFE.zip)

This was built for the 1.2.5 Saleae Logic software and should work on future releases.

To install, simply copy the correct DLL to the analyzers folder, usually located here: C:\Program Files\Saleae LLC\Analyzers

If you have any trouble with it, please contact support. The analyzer itself is open source and not officially supported, but we can still help debug issues.
