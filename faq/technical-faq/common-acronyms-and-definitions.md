    seconds

* ms

    millisecond, or a thousandth of a second

* us

* I2C

    Inter-Integrated Circuit

* SPI

    Serial Peripheral Interface

* SWI

    Single Wire Interface \(Atmel\)

* CAN

    Controller Area Network

* HDLC

    High-level Data Link Control

* HDMI CEC

    High-Definition Multimedia Interface Consumer Electronics Control

* I2S

    Inter-IC Sound

* PCM

    Pulse-Code Modulation

* JTAG

    Joint Test Action Group

* LIN

    Local Interconnect Network

* MDIO

    Management Data Input/Output

* MIDI

    Musical Instrument Digital Interface

* SMBus

    System Management Bus

* SWD

    Serial Wire Debug

* UNI/O

    \(not an acronym\), a protocol made by Microchip

* USB LS/FS

    Universal Serial Bus Low Speed / Full Speed

* Baud rate

    data rate measured in bits per second

* MSB

    most significant bit

* LSB

    least significant bit

* Parity

    additional information added to the data to provide error detection information

* processing backlog

    In the Saleae software, the data recorded from the device is transformed to the storage format as it is recorded, in near-real time. If the process is unable to keep up with the recording in real time, the processing backlog will grow as unprocessed data are buffered.

* trigger backlog

    In the Saleae software, when the trigger is used, the processed data are then fed into the trigger in near real-time. If the trigger thread is unable to process the already transformed data in real time, the trigger backlog will grow as processed \(but not yet searched\) data are buffered.
