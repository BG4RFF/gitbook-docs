# Do I Need to Calibrate Saleae Logic?

No calibration is required for the Saleae devices. You can download our statement of no calibration required below:

[Statement of No Calibration Required](http://downloads.saleae.com/specs/No+Calibration+Required+Statement.pdf)

Specifically, there is no calibration certificate, and periodic recalibration is not required. The devices do undergo a one-time factory calibration process. More information about calibration can be found below.
