# Can a Capture Be Cropped or Trimmed to a Smaller Subset?

Right now you can export a specific portion of the file to CSV or another format, but unfortunately, there is no way to trim the file itself.

I would agree that this seems like something it should be able to do. Hopefully, we can get it in there soon.
