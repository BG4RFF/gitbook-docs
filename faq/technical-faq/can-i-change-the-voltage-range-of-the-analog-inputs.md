# Can I Change the Voltage Range of the Analog Inputs?

All Saleae devices with analog inputs have fixed analog voltage range. They do not support a hardware analog zoom like oscilloscopes do. For more information about the differences between the Saleae products and oscilloscopes, see this article: [https://trello.com/c/m8M0kbT6](https://trello.com/c/m8M0kbT6)
