## Is It Possible to Trigger On a Protocol Frame or Pattern of Bytes?

Unfortunately, the software does not currently have a trigger on protocol feature.

However, we do have a built-in protocol search that lets you search through the protocol results. We recommend taking a longer capture without a trigger and then searching it for the trigger condition you are looking for.

The current protocol search does not support searching for sequences of results. It just supports searching for single results.

We are looking into adding proper trigger on protocol as well as sequence searching.
