# Does the Saleae Logic Software Support Windows 10 Tablets or Windows RT Tablets?

The Saleae Logic software does install and run on Windows 10 tablets. Most features will work with a stylus or touch interface, although tablet-specific gestures such as pinch-to-zoom are currently not supported. Zooming out is also not supported with touch.

The Saleae Logic software currently does not support Windows RT tablets. You can read more about our supported operating systems here: [https://trello.com/c/CRFmqCP3](https://trello.com/c/CRFmqCP3)
