## Does the Saleae Logic Support the Raspberry Pi?

Unfortunately, the Logic Software cannot run on ARM, Raspberry Pi, or Android devices.

It is something we've thought a lot about, and there is a possibility that we will do it in the future, but for now, we can't spare the resources. It would make sense in the context of some larger plans we are considering. It would be really cool and helpful for many, I think. Hopefully, we will have the chance to do it.

We don't have any other libraries that use the device, either. The Logic software is the only way to communicate with the hardware.

Ultimately, Android support would be nice, too, although that would also require a complete UI redesign. So it's not currently on the road map at all.
