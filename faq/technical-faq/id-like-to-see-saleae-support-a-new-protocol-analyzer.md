# I'd Like to See Saleae Support a New Protocol Analyzer

If you find that there is a protocol analyzer missing in the Logic software or you need support to add a new protocol analyzer:

1. Check our [https://trello.com/c/lzSifL1x](https://trello.com/c/lzSifL1x) list to see if it has already been made. If you need any help building it, please feel free to [contact us!](http://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
2. Check our [Ideas Page](http://ideas.saleae.com) to suggest a new protocol analyzer or vote on an already existing idea.
3. You can also create your own protocol analyzer by using our [https://trello.com/c/YHJKmcns](https://trello.com/c/YHJKmcns). Since we use the same SDK, you will have complete flexibility on how your custom analyzer decodes data. Please note that using our SDK requires working knowledge of C++.
4. If a new protocol seems like it can be decoded by an already existing protocol analyzer, feel free to [contact us](http://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to check if it's doable.
