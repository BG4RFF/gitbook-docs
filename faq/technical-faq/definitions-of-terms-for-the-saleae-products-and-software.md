# Definitions of Terms for the Saleae Products and Software

* MS/s \(megasamples per second\) is millions of samples per second. It's the rate at which an input is sampled during a recording. Along with other factors, it determines the maximum bandwidth of a capture.
* kS/s \(kilosamples per second\) is the same as MS/s except it is thousands of samples per second.
* MHz \(Megahertz\) is millions of cycles per second. It is a measure of frequency, usually in reference to bandwidth.
* Protocol Analyzer is a software plugin for the Saleae software that will decode standardized signals into bytes.
