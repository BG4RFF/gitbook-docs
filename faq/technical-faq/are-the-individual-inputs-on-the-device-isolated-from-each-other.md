# Are the Individual Inputs on the Device Isolated from Each Other?

No. All inputs on every product share a common ground internally, and that ground is also shared with the USB connection, and thus the host PC.

For more information about isolation, please see this article: [https://trello.com/c/zcat9hME](https://trello.com/c/zcat9hME)

For digital channel-to-channel isolation, we suggest considering this eval kit from SI Labs: [http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/SI84XXISO-KIT/336-1765-ND/2170672](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/SI84XXISO-KIT/336-1765-ND/2170672)

For isolation from the host PC, we suggest considering this USB 2.0 high-speed isolator: [http://intona.eu/usbiso](http://intona.eu/usbiso)
