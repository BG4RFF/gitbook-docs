## Are .logicdata files Backward and Forward Compatible?

\*.logicdata files are forward compatible. That means that files saved with older versions of the software can be opened by newer versions of the software.

However, backward compatibility is not supported. You cannot open newer files with other versions of the software.

**Error Loading 1.1.15 Files in the Latest Beta Software**

If you are unable to load older files in the newer software, this is a bug. Contact us for support.
