# How Are Things Going?

Pretty good! We've just started working on a new support flow where we record the answers to just about every support question and post them here. Initially, we will answer each question as it arrives in a public way and post it here. Then we will respond with a link.

In the future, we will connect these answers to a powerful support system that will make self-service support a breeze.

Hopefully, this will help reduce support volume since our developers are also the ones who handle all technical support. Once running smoothly, we should have a lot more time to write code.

So far so good!
