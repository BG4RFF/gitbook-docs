# The Logic Software's Data Export Feature Is Not Working Properly

First, please review the data export information found here: [https://trello.com/c/7zCKDekD](https://trello.com/c/7zCKDekD).

If you are working with protocol export, see here: [https://trello.com/c/rOusLFdv](https://trello.com/c/rOusLFdv).

Also, please review the software bug/crash guide to see what information is required when reporting an issue: [https://trello.com/c/no5pJ8YB](https://trello.com/c/no5pJ8YB). Be sure to include this information if you contact support.

To best debug this issue, please send a copy of the \*.logicdata capture file to [Saleae support](https://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). If the file is too large to attach but under 1 GB, please send us a Dropbox link if you use Dropbox. If not, let us know, and we can send you a Dropbox file upload request.

Once we have the file here, we can try exporting it to see if we can reproduce the problem.
