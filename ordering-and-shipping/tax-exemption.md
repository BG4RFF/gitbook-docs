# Tax Exemption

## Tax Exemption

If your company is exempt from paying taxes, you must provide your tax exemption certificate to us. 

If you have placed an order with us before, then we may already have your certificate on file. In this case, please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) anyways to ensure we subtract tax charges from your next order.

### Process for Removing Tax Charges

1. Before placing your order, [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let us know you would like sales tax removed on your next order. Include an attachment of your tax exemption certificate.
2. If approved, we will send a confirmation email instructing you to place the order with the sales tax included. 
3. Let us know immediately after the order is placed and provide your 4-digit order number. We will make sure to remove the sales tax from your order and we will send you an updated invoice.

### Refund of Tax Charges

If the order has already shipped, then the sales tax has already been collected. Please [contact us](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach your tax exemption certificate. After approval, we can provide a refund of the tax charges.
