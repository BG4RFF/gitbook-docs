# Receiving Invoices

If you ordered online from www.saleae.com, you should have received an email with a link to your invoice when you placed your order.

If you are unable to locate that email or if you placed an order over the phone or with a PO, [please contact Saleae support](https://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

When requesting an invoice, please provide as much of the following information as possible. If you can't find all the information, that's fine.

* Was the order placed with a PO, over the phone, or online at www.saleae.com?
* any ID number\(s\) you can locate from the order
* the email address from the order
* the company name or purchaser name for the order
* the date the order was placed

The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for us to locate your order.
