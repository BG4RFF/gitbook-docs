# Shipping Policy

We primarily ship with FedEx. To check which options are available in your country, simply add an item to the cart on www.saleae.com and select your country. In the United States, you need to first enter your zip code to see the available shipping options. You can find the price of shipping at the same time.

If you are shipping to a country outside the US, there will likely be additional charges for duty and tax, due on receipt. In some locations \(i.e., most of the EU\), we offer the ability to pre-pay import taxes such as VAT. You will see what options are available on the cart page.

### **In-Stock Items**

Normally, orders placed before 12 pm PST on weekdays are shipped the same day. The stocking status \(in stock or out of stock\) is displayed under each item in your cart.

### **Out-of-Stock Items**

If an item is not in stock, an estimated time of shipment is displayed in your cart. This is our estimate, but sometimes it may take longer to ship than indicated. If any of your items are out of stock, your entire order will be held until it can be shipped in full, but you may contact us to make other arrangements.

### **Order Emails and Tracking Numbers**

As soon as your order is placed, you will receive an email from us confirming the details. If you need to make any changes, please contact us as soon as possible. A link to change your address is provided in the email.

After your order ships, you will receive a second email with a tracking number and a link to check the tracking number. Please note that the tracking number may not appear in the system for up to 24 hours.

### **International Shipping**

Saleae regularly ships internationally using FedEx.

For some countries, we have made arrangements so FedEx will charge us your customs fees and you will not get a customs bill. If this is the case, it will be clearly indicated in the shopping cart.

For countries in which you are responsible to pay your own customs bill, this will be clearly indicated in the shopping cart, and you will be required to check a box indicating that you understand this.

### **No Shipping Days**

Saleae observes the typical United States holidays and does not ship on New Year's Day \(January 1\), Memorial Day \(last Monday in May\), Independence Day \(July 4\), Labor Day \(first Monday in September\), Thanksgiving Day \(fourth Thursday in November\), and Christmas Day \(December 25\).
