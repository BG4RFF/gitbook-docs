# How Can I Find the Current Status of My Order?

To get updates on an order, [please contact Saleae support](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and include the order ID number, PO number, or any other identifying information so we can look it up.

Orders placed online at www.saleae.com usually ship within one business day, unless one or more of the items in the order are out of stock. If any items are out of stock, you should have been required to check a box on the cart page acknowledging this.

When an order is placed online, you should immediately receive an email confirmation. If you are missing that confirmation, [please contact Saleae support](https://contact.saleae.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

When your order ships, another email is sent containing the tracking number. If you have already received that email, use the tracking link included to monitor your shipment's progress. Please note that those emails are sent when the label is created, which is a few hours before the packages are picked up and scanned into the system. You may need to wait until after 5 PM PST before the tracking number registers with the carrier's website.
