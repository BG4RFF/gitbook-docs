The latest Saleae Logic Beta software can be downloaded below. We've started releasing beta versions of the software to test new features and bug fixes. Once we can verify its stability, we will make it available as a stable release download.

### **Installing for Windows**

Simply download and run the installer. It is the same as other software you have installed in the past. During the installation, you will be prompted if you want to trust software from Saleae \(you do\). That is because we install a driver for the Logic hardware.

### **If the Installer fails with an Error on Windows**

You can try running the standalone version of the software, which does not need to be installed. Simply extract it and run Logic.exe. Since the installer normally handles driver installation, you may need to manually install the driver if you use the standalone version. The driver files are included with the standalone download. The standalone version can be downloaded from the software release links above.

### **Installing for Mac**

Simply download, double-click, and drag the Logic software into the Application folder. It is the same as other Mac software you have installed in the past.

### **Installing for Linux**

Download the zip file and extract it. The software will run from this folder. You can leave this folder on your desktop or move it anywhere that has write permissions. Launch the Logic software by opening the folder and double-clicking the Logic executable. You may want to make a shortcut to this executable for more convenient access.

### **Installing for Linux â€“ Driver**

Before using the software with Logic hardware, you'll need to give the application permission to access the device \(otherwise you'll have to launch the application with sudo\). To do this, unplug any attached Logic device\(s\). From the command line, navigate to the _Driver_ folder and run the script _install_driver.sh.
